## Technical Details

### Requirements

- Modern web browser with camera support
- HTTPS connection (required for camera access in most browsers)
- Internet connection (for Tesseract.js OCR library)

### Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 53+
- Firefox 36+
- Safari 11+
- Edge 79+

### OCR Technology

The app uses [Tesseract.js](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js), a JavaScript library that provides OCR capabilities directly in the browser. It supports:

- English text recognition
- Automatic text cleaning and formatting
- Real-time processing

## File Structure

```
text_extractor/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main application file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css          # Styling and layout
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js           # Application logic
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # This file
```

## Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing**: All text extraction happens locally in your browser
- **No Server Required**: No data is sent to external servers
- **Local Storage**: Extracted text is stored only in your browser's local storage
- **Camera Access**: Camera is only active when explicitly started and stopped

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Working
- Ensure you're using HTTPS (required for camera access)
- Check that your browser supports camera access
- Grant camera permissions when prompted
- Try refreshing the page and granting permissions again

### Text Not Extracting
- Ensure good lighting conditions
- Hold the tin container steady and clearly visible
- Make sure text is within the green capture frame
- Try adjusting the angle or distance from the camera

### Poor Text Recognition
- Improve lighting conditions
- Clean the tin container surface
- Ensure text is not blurry or distorted
- Try capturing from different angles

## Development

To modify or extend the application:

1. **Add New Features**: Edit `script.js` to add new functionality
2. **Modify Styling**: Update `styles.css` for visual changes
3. **Change OCR Settings**: Modify the Tesseract configuration in the `extractText` method

### Key Functions

- `startCamera()`: Initializes camera access
- `captureAndExtract()`: Captures image and triggers OCR
- `processExtractedText()`: Handles text processing and duplicate detection
- `saveTexts()`: Persists data to local storage
